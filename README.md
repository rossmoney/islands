Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------

- Code can be found in IslandController and in a trait called Island.
- I spent about 3 hours on this.
- Given more time I would have formatted the json using a laravel plugin, or maybe on the frontend using a javascript framework. I would have shown the islands in a different colour to the sea.
- I have put the calculation code in a trait to keep it seperate and so it can be reused elsewhere in the application.
- Possibly would have written it so that multiple maps could be stored along with their island counts.

- To run - php artisan serve, output is on home page
